### Hi everyone! üëã

My name is **Kirill** *(full name: Afanasyev Kirill Aleksandrovich, also known as Zerumi)* and I'm novice computer software engineer and 3rd year banchelor student at ITMO University! I aimed for fast-growing, learning new things & becoming better every day! I take inspiration from our industry and my friends, who also interested in software engineering.

Currently I'm learning **Kotlin** for Android and Multiplatform projects. And Kotlin is my favourite language. <3

#### You can view my brilliant projects below, in 'Pinned' tab. It often written in C#, Kotlin and Java.

Or more good & recent projects I've done during my learning in university:
- [Declarative .bmp image transformer](https://github.com/Zerumi-ITMO-Related/programming-languages/tree/master/c/ch13_10/solution/src). Support file i/o & .bmp load/save + blurring and rotating image, in declarative way. (written in C)
- [Full-stack equation solver](https://github.com/Zerumi/cmath2_070923_1/tree/master). Support custom equation & system of equation input + visualizing it's graph. (Ktor + KVision)

Fun fact: I had written a [stack-machine emulator](https://github.com/Zerumi/csa3-140324-asm-stack) with my own assembly language, and then I wrote a [linear function approximation application](https://github.com/Zerumi-ITMO-Related/cmath4_290424_1) on it. About ~1.5k loc including I/O and number parsing.
